Getting and Cleaning Data, Course Project

This repository contains an R processing script that uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, processes it, and presents a tidy data set based on its results. 

The project website can be found here: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The project data directory (zipped) is available here: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script should be source in R with the current directory containing the (unzipped) data directory, titled "UCI HAR Dataset".
